Lastly but not leastly, a message of thanks to all the teachers from Vilniaus Technologijų Mokymo Centras for providing sufficient and necessary knowledge,  
understanding and grasp to build this social media platform. Particularly thankful to Justina Balsė, Greta Grigelionytė and Tomas Tribušauskas who enabled me to  
build up the fundamental skills of programming and inspired me to become a more fluent medium still between browsers and human beings

Special thanks to Mark Z.
